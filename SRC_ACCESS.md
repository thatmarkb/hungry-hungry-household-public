# Source code access (private submodule)

This repository contains public product/design documentation.

The application source code lives in a private Git submodule at `./src`.
If you have been granted access to the private repo, clone with submodules:

  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/thatmarkb/hungry-hungry-household-public.git

Or after cloning:

  git submodule update --init --recursive

To request access, contact the maintainer.
